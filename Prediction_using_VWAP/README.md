## For Prediction_using_VWAP.ipynb,
### So I have done series of analysis on the stock price of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Limited.
I have used the **VWAP** price of the stock to predict the stock price. 
### I have used 50 historical observation to predict the next future observation.
I have used the following models to predict the stock price:
1. Single Layered RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
The root mean square error of the model is 12.73
2. Double Layered RNN
The root mean square error of the model is 11.86
2. LSTM (Long Short Term Memory)
The root mean square error of the model is 14.28
