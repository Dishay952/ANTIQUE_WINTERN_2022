## For Classification_Stock_Direction.ipynb, 
I have taken the data after GFC and before the pandemic because of continuity in dataset.
I am using the 5 days return of the stock to predict the direction of the stock.
The features are the close price of the stock and the volume traded and the target is the direction of the stock.
I have used the following models to predict the direction of the stock:
1. Logistic Regression 
2. K-Nearest Neighbors
3. Decision Tree
4. Random Forest
5. Support Vector Machine
6. Naive Bayes
### The best accuracy was recored by Random Forest with 64% accuracy.
### The best precision was recored by Naive Bayes with 100% precision.
### The best recall was recored by Naive Bayes with 62.9% recall.
### The best F1_score was recored by Random Forest with 76.8% F1.
